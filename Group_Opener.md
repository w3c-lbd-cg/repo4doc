# The text [DRAFT]:

This group unites globally experts in the area of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Web of Data technologies. It forms a melting point for experts from both industry and academia, which are working together to specifically address the challenges of integrating heterogeneous data in the built environment over the building and infrastructure life cycle using web of data technologies. The members of the group seek to define existing and future use cases and requirements for linked data based applications across the life cycle of buildings.

The envisioned target beneficiaries of this group are both industrial, academic and governmental organisations who use data from building information modelling applications and other data related to the building life cycle (sensor data, GIS data, material data, geographical data, etc.) to achieve their business processes and whom will benefit from greater integration of data and interoperability between their data sets. The groups will engage with other groups at the W3C on related topics such as threedimensional data. The group will engage with its beneficiaries through surveys, events and workshops in the domain. In particular, many members of the group support and participate the series on Linked Data for Architecture and Construction (LDAC) as well as other conferences and meetings.

More information on the group can be found in the related reports and websites accessible through links provided on this page.
