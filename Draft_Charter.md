# [DRAFT] W3C Linked Building Data Community Group Charter

## Introduction

This group unites globally experts in the area of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and

Web of Data technologies. It forms a melting point for experts from both industry and academia, which are working together to specifically address the challenges of integrating heterogeneous data in the built environment over the building and infrastructure life cycle using web of data technologies.

## Mission and Goals

Our mission, through the use of web of data technologies, is to establish a new modular and web-based paradigm for BIM to address existing open challenges when producing BIM deliverables. This includes integrating heterogeneous building and infrastructure data from various domains over various stages of the building life cycle to enable seamless data creation, exchange and management.

  

Our goal as global melting point is to seek funding and foster industry participation to underpin the technology with respective standards through working group spin-offs. In addition, the group seeks to highlight examples showcasing the added value of using web of data technologies for the benefit of a smarter and interconnected built environment. The groups actively works to inform and educate interested users on the topic. In case working groups cannot be initiated the groups goal is to publish its result as reports.

## Scope

The group focuses on various topics and fields related to the application of web of data technologies in the built environment over the whole life cycle of a construction. This includes:

  

-   Formal modelling of the domain
    
-   Investigating modular approaches for Building Information Modelling
    
-   Increase alignments among heterogeneous ontologies in the domain by automated matching methods
    
-   Investigate best practices in practical modelling of properties for the built environment
    
-   Educate -> e.g. Summer Schools
    
-   Attract and foster industry participation
    

  

The domains of interest include:

  

-   Building Product Data (Classification and Properties)
    
-   HVAC equipment
    
-   Geometry
    
-   Electrical equipment
    
-   Building Performance Simulation
    
-   Building Automation Systems
    
-   Building Materials
    
-   Structural Engineering
    
-   Process and project management, cost data
    
-   Sensor and actuator data from monitoring
    
-   Conservation
    
-   Weather
    
-   Geoinformation
    
-   Infrastructure
    

  

The members of this group are aware that other community groups and working groups at the W3C exist focusing on some of these domains, for example geometry, and seek the contact with other groups to work jointly on these topics.

## Deliverables

### Normative specifications

As a community group no normative specifications are published by the group. However, it is intended to forward outcomes of the group into W3C standardisation process when possible.

  

### Other Deliverables

To document the groupÂ´s work its output is published as [Community Group Report (CGR)](https://www.w3.org/community/reports/reqs/). Current CGR efforts are:

  

-   Building Topology Ontology (BOT)
    
-   Property Modelling Profiles
    
-   Best practices to publish BIM data in the Web of Data
    
-   Use Cases and Requirements for LBD
    
-   ...
    

  

## Liaisons

-   [W3C Web of Things Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/wot/)
    
-   [Workshop on Linked Data in Architecture and Construction series](http://www.linkedbuildingdata.net/)
    
-   BuildingSMART - Technical Room - Linked Data Working Group
    

  

## Participation

Anyone may join this Community Group and can register on the groups [home page](https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/participants/). All participants in this group have to sign the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).

  

## Communication

The group maintains several modes of communication. On a regular basis teleconferences are held, which are open for all groups participants and invited speakers. The details for the meetings are announced in advance of the calls via the internal mailing list. All meeting minutes of the teleconferences are archived for public review. As every W3C Community Group the group maintains a [public-lbd@w3.org](mailto:public.lbd@w3.org) open to anyone. Public communication and documentation of decisions are sent here. Also a [internal-lbd@w3.org](mailto:internal-lbd@w3.org) mailing list readable only by group participants, W3C Members and W3C Staff is maintained.

In addition the group maintains a [GitHub repository](https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/). Issues can be tracked there and the public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.

## Decision Policy

  

This group will seek to make decisions through consensus. If consensus isn't clear, there is a call for consensus allowing seven day online feedback for a proposed course of action and afterwards the decision is made by majority vote. Any decisions reached should be recorded in the groups public mailing list.

  

It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favor or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.

## Code of ethics and professional conduct

The group adopts the [code of ethics and professional conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) of the W3C. Thereby here an excerpt of the full code of ethics is copied.

  

1.  Treat each other with [respect](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Respect), professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
    
2.  Never [harass](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Harassment) or [bully](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Workplace) anyone verbally, physically or [sexually](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Sexual).
    
3.  Never [discriminate](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Discrimination) on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
    
4.  Communicate constructively and avoid [demeaning](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Demeaning) or [insulting](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Insulting) behavior or language.
    
5.  Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and [acknowledge](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Acknowledgement) properly the contributions of others.
    
6.  Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to [conflicts of interest](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies.html#coi).
    
7.  Respect the [privacy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/process.html#confidentiality-levels) of others and the [confidentiality](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/process.html#confidentiality-levels) of data you access.
    
8.  With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or [unwelcome behavior](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Unwelcome) or [advances](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Advance).
    
9.  Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a [leadership position](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Leadership)) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.
