# repo4doc

This is a repo to serve as a git-based editing possibility of some documents of the W3C LBD CG.
This branch has been created to allow collaborative editing of a community group charter for the W3C Linked Building Data Community Group.

The document is a condensed, updated output of the groupÂ´s websites and published documents. The draft version of the document has been prepared by the authors as listed in the contribution section of this repository. However, it can always contain errors or false statements as well as is no official output of the group until it has been accepted by its members.

## Current status

In particular the following documents are included as input:

1. [Draft Working Group Charter](https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/lbd/charter/) published via github.io -> Should be removed, no WG planned
2. CG Report [Use Cases and Requirements](https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/lbd/UseCasesAndRequirements/) published via github.io --> Should be improved and published as report
 3. [Group Opener/ Manifest](https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/lbd/) published via github.io --> Has overlap with ambiguity with W3C CG opener (below)
4. [W3C CG opener](https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/) published via w3.org
 5. [Seed use cases (https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/wiki/Seed_Use_Cases) published via w3.org --> should be removed when integrated with report
 6. [Wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/wiki/Main_Page) published via w3.org --> Redundant: outdated Meetings & minutes, events, use cases
